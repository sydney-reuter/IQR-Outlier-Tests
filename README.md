# IQR-Outlier-Tests

This project was created for George Mason University class CRIM 515, Criminal Justice Research Methods and Data Analysis. The project investigates how police shootings vary by state, vitcim race, and presence of a body camera. Data was obtained from the Washington Post and US Census Bureau. Statistical visuals and analyses include line charts, bar charts, contour maps, boxplots, linear regressions, IQR tests for outliers, and a proportions test.
